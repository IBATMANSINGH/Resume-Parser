## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-parser.git
   cd resume-parser
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the spaCy language model:
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

## üìù Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run App.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Upload resumes using the file uploader in the sidebar

4. Paste the job description in the provided text area

5. Click "Process Resumes" to analyze and rank the candidates

6. Review the ranked results and explore candidate details

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Target Skills

Modify the `TARGET_SKILLS` list in `App.py` to customize the skills the parser looks for:

```python
TARGET_SKILLS = [
    'python', 'java', 'c++', 'javascript', 'sql', 'nosql', 'mongodb',
    # Add or remove skills relevant to your needs
]
```

### Scoring Algorithm

The current scoring is based on a simple count of matching skills. You can enhance the algorithm in the `calculate_match_score` function for more sophisticated ranking.

## üß© How It Works

1. **Text Extraction**: Converts PDF/DOCX files to plain text
2. **Information Extraction**: Uses regex and NLP to extract contact details, names, and skills
3. **Job Description Analysis**: Identifies required skills from the job posting
4. **Matching Algorithm**: Compares resume skills against job requirements
5. **Ranking**: Orders candidates by match score
6. **Results Display**: Presents information in an interactive table

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **spaCy**: Natural Language Processing
- **PyPDF2**: PDF text extraction
- **python-docx**: DOCX file processing
- **pandas**: Data handling and manipulation
